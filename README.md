Social Playlist
Oct 21-22, 2017 THacks2 project

>>Website that allows users to create party playlists from their Spotify account.
Party participants can use code to add, up-vote or down-vote songs. Songs with higher votes will automatically move up in the playlist. Songs down-voted by 75% (or higher) of the population will be automatically removed from the playlist. Newly added songs will be defaulted to 0 up-votes, 0 down-votes, and automatically inserted at the end of the playlist.
