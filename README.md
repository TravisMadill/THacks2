#THacks2 project

What's a great party without great music? 

Been to a party where you're having fun, but then that ONE horriblely overplayed song comes on and ruins your day?

Easily accessible webapp that allow guests to have a say in what goes into the playlist!
Hosts can log in with their Spotify accounts to create a basic playlist for their big event. Then a code will be distributed and any guest with a code can up-vote or down-vote songs in the playlists. They can also add/recommend songs by either searching on Spotify or Linking via Youtube. Songs down-voted by 75% of the population or higher will be automatically removed from the playlist. Any new songs that are added will not be played until it has at least one up-vote.

Sociafy-- leading to better parties.
